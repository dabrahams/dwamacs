;;; Commentary:

;; Emacs conveniently allows one to work on different parts of the same
;; buffer at the same time, but the rules governing buffer display are, for
;; some people's editing habits, less than ideal.  Suppose for example that
;; one is editing two parts of buffer <buf> in windows <win1> and <win2>,
;; switches briefly to another buffer in <win2>, then returns to editing
;; <buf> in <win2>.  This latter window will now display the same part of
;; <buf> as <win1>, rather than the portion that one was just recently
;; editing in it.  Per-window-point creates persistent values of point and
;; window-start, so that in cases like that just described <win2> will return
;; to its previous position in <buf>.

;; In some cases, such as looking up a function definition via
;; `describe-function', it makes sense for per-window-point to allow other
;; Lisp programs to fix the value of point.  The package is reasonably
;; intelligent in identifying when when it should do so.  Further control
;; over repositioning is provided by the variables `pwp-no-reposition-names',
;; `pwp-no-reposition-regexps', and `pwp-reposition-tests'.  Note also that
;; the package always ignores minibuffer windows.

;; To install the package, put this file in your load path and put:
;;
;;  (require 'per-window-point)
;;
;; in your .emacs.  To toggle per-window-point on and off, use the command
;; `pwp-mode', or place 
;;
;;  (pwp-mode 1)
;;
;; in your .emacs to enable it automatically.

Per-window-point mode changes how Emacs selects point when displaying a
buffer in a window.  While pwp-mode is enabled, each window
keeps a record of the last value of point in every buffer that
has been displayed in that window.  When switched back to one of
those buffers, the window will display that portion of the buffer
that was last displayed in that window.  

The mode is intelligent in inferring when it should defer to
other programs in setting point.  Further control over when
repositioning should happen is provided by the variables
`pwp-no-reposition-names', `pwp-no-reposition-regexps',
and `pwp-reposition-tests'."
