;;; elhome --- A framework for a "home" Emacs configuration

;; Description:
;; Everything you need to hang your emacs customizations off of,
;; install your own packages, etc., without the system becoming
;; unscalable


;; Install:
;; You can use this file as your .emacs (or .emacs.d/init.el)
;; directly, or symlink to it. If you need to customize where things
;; are stored (see elhome-directory below for example) you can load it
;; from your .emacs after setting up some constants.

;; *** IMPORTANT NOTE ***: I would rather call this module ElHombre,
;; but can't find a good excuse.
